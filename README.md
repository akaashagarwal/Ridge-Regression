# Ridge Regression From Scratch

This project is to implement Linear Regression with L2-Regularization from scratch in Python.
A simple batch Gradient Descent algorithm is used to optimize the cost function.

Exploratory data analysis and visualizations weren't performed as the goal was not to achieve high accuracy in predictions, but to build an algorithm from scratch and achieve comparable performance to built-in modules from sci-kit learn so as to test the correctness of the algorithm built from scratch.
